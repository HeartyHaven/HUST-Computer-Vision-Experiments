## Experiment Content
- **exp1:** Design a feedforward neural network for binary classification of 2D vectors.
- **exp2:** Design a convolutional neural network for the ten-class classification task on MNIST handwritten digits.
- **exp3:** Design a neural network for binary classification to determine if multiple MNIST handwritten digits are identical.
- **exp4:** Implement neural network interpretability algorithms Grad-CAM and Layer-CAM, and use these algorithms to analyze the feature extraction of AlexNet on three sample images.
- **exp_final:** Comprehensive experiment, write a review report in the field of computer vision or a special report on interpretability analysis (requires reproducing related algorithms).

## Project Structure
Each `exp{x}` is a project file for an experiment, containing code and a report. All code is written in Jupyter Notebook and can be reproduced on a CPU. Each of exp1, exp2, exp3, and exp4 includes control experiments, which may require changing parameters and running multiple times. Specific parameter settings can be referenced in the experiment reports or the names of comparative analysis images in the `imgs` folder. Please adjust accordingly.
